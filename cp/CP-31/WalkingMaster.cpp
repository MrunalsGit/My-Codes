// Prob: We are at (a,b) and need to reach (c,d)

// count min num of steps
// Sol:
// First reach to the level of d 
// as we only have option to move above
// if(b > d) therefore we can never reach to (c,d)
// else num of steps required to reach (diffY) = d - b 
// steps = diffY
// as we have moved diffY steps up simultaneously a also increased therefore (a + diffY) is new a cordinate
// now we reached level of d, we can only move back ward as if we move forward our y cordinate will also increase
// therefore if(c > (a + diffY)) therefore in this case we can never reach (c,d)
// else more steps required to reach (c,d) = (a + diffY) - c
// steps = (diffY) + (a + diffY - c)
// put diffY = d - b
// steps = (d - b) + (a + (d - b) - c)
// steps = a - 2b - c + 2d
